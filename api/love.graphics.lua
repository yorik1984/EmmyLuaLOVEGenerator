---@namespace love

---The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.
---
---LÖVE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.
---
---In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.
---
---Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.
love.graphics = {}

--region Canvas

---A Canvas is used for off-screen rendering. Think of it as an invisible screen that you can draw to, but that will not be visible until you draw it to the actual visible screen. It is also known as "render to texture".
---
---By drawing things that do not change position often (such as background items) to the Canvas, and then drawing the entire Canvas instead of each item,  you can reduce the number of draw operations performed each frame.
---
---In versions prior to love.graphics.isSupported("canvas") could be used to check for support at runtime.

---
---The Canvas must be created with mipmaps set to a MipmapMode other than 'none' for this function to work. It should only be called while the Canvas is not the active render target.
---
---If the mipmap mode is set to 'auto', this function is automatically called inside love.graphics.setCanvas when switching from this Canvas to another Canvas or to the main screen.

---
---For example, a texture with pixel dimensions of 100x100 with a DPI scale factor of 2 will be drawn as if it was 50x50. This is useful with high-dpi /  retina displays to easily allow swapping out higher or lower pixel density Images and Canvases without needing any extra manual scaling logic.

---Draws a Drawable object (an Image, Canvas, SpriteBatch, ParticleSystem, Mesh, Text object, or Video) on the screen with optional rotation, scaling and shearing.
---
---Objects are drawn relative to their local coordinate system. The origin is by default located at the top left corner of Image and Canvas. All scaling, shearing, and rotation arguments transform the object relative to that point. Also, the position of the origin can be specified on the screen coordinate system.
---
---It's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation. One can also use a negative scaling factor to flip about its centerline. 
---
---Note that the offsets are applied before rotation, scaling, or shearing; scaling and shearing are applied before rotation.
---
---The right and bottom edges of the object are shifted at an angle defined by the shearing factors.
---
---When using the default shader anything drawn with this function will be tinted according to the currently selected color.  Set it to pure white to preserve the object's original colors.

---Creates a new array Image.
---
---An array image / array texture is a single object which contains multiple 'layers' or 'slices' of 2D sub-images. It can be thought of similarly to a texture atlas or sprite sheet, but it doesn't suffer from the same tile / quad bleeding artifacts that texture atlases do – although every sub-image must have the same dimensions.
---
---A specific layer of an array image can be drawn with love.graphics.drawLayer / SpriteBatch:addLayer, or with the Quad variant of love.graphics.draw and Quad:setLayer, or via a custom Shader.
---
---To use an array image in a Shader, it must be declared as a ArrayImage or sampler2DArray type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(ArrayImage image, vec3 texturecoord) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from a slice of the array image. The vec3 argument contains the texture coordinate in the first two components, and the 0-based slice index in the third component.

---Creates a new cubemap Image.
---
---Cubemap images have 6 faces (sides) which represent a cube. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a cubemap image in a Shader, it must be declared as a CubeImage or samplerCube type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(CubeImage image, vec3 direction) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the cubemap. The vec3 argument is a normalized direction from the center of the cube, rather than explicit texture coordinates.
---
---Each face in a cubemap image must have square dimensions.

---The purpose of a Quad is to use a fraction of an image to draw objects, as opposed to drawing entire image. It is most useful for sprite sheets and atlases: in a sprite atlas, multiple sprites reside in same image, quad is used to draw a specific sprite from that image; in animated sprites with all frames residing in the same image, quad is used to draw specific frame from the animation.

---Creates a new Shader object for hardware-accelerated vertex and pixel effects. A Shader contains either vertex shader code, pixel shader code, or both.
---
---Shaders are small programs which are run on the graphics card when drawing. Vertex shaders are run once for each vertex (for example, an image has 4 vertices - one at each corner. A Mesh might have many more.) Pixel shaders are run once for each pixel on the screen which the drawn object touches. Pixel shader code is executed after all the object's vertices have been processed by the vertex shader.

---Creates a new volume (3D) Image.
---
---Volume images are 3D textures with width, height, and depth. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a volume image in a Shader, it must be declared as a VolumeImage or sampler3D type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(VolumeImage image, vec3 texcoords) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the volume image. The vec3 argument is a normalized texture coordinate with the z component representing the depth to sample at (ranging from 1).
---
---Volume images are typically used as lookup tables in shaders for color grading, for example, because sampling using a texture coordinate that is partway in between two pixels can interpolate across all 3 dimensions in the volume image, resulting in a smooth gradient even when a small-sized volume image is used as the lookup table.
---

---Draws formatted text, with word wrap and alignment.
---
---See additional notes in love.graphics.print.
---
---The word wrap limit is applied before any scaling, rotation, and other coordinate transformations. Therefore the amount of text per line stays constant given the same wrap limit, even if the scale arguments change.
---
---In version 0.9.2 and earlier, wrapping was implemented by breaking up words by spaces and putting them back together to make sure things fit nicely within the limit provided. However, due to the way this is done, extra spaces between words would end up missing when printed on the screen, and some lines could overflow past the provided wrap limit. In version 0.10.0 and newer this is no longer the case.
---
---In versions prior to 11.0, color and byte component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

---Rotates the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---Calling this function affects all future drawing operations by rotating the coordinate system around the origin by the given amount of radians. This change lasts until love.draw() exits.

---@param angle number # The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians.

---Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---By default the coordinate system in LÖVE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.
---
---After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.
